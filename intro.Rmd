## Introduction 
About Harry: Harry is a 4th year Stats Major and Commerce Minro Student at UBC. He likes sports a lot and he goes to the gym often. He is taking Stat 450 this year. Today Harry did some knitting and he thinks it's okay. His friends also helped him knit with different tools.

## Favourite Equation: 
My favourite equation is: $1^2+2^2+3^2 +.... + n^2 = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+1)}{6}$ This equation is one of the fundemental equations used in Calculus.

## Favourite Dataset:

My favourite Dataset: is the S&P500 dataset with 

``` {r, echo = FALSE}

setwd("~/Desktop/")
library(tseries)
library(zoo)
SP500 <- read.csv("data_csv.csv")
timeseries <- ts(data = SP500$Real.Price)
plot.ts(timeseries)


```
